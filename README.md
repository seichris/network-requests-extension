# Network Request Analyzer Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you find which network request contains the specific information you're looking for. Instead of manually inspecting hundreds of network calls, simply describe what you need and let the extension pinpoint the exact request with that data.

## Why This Matters for zkTLS

One of the main features of zkTLS is that it scales to any webservice, where traditional APIs only work for services that host them. This extension aims to make creating and maintaining zkTLS templates easier, and thus allowing more people to create and maintain those APIs.

## Features

### üîç Keyword Search
- Capture all network requests from any website
- Search for specific keywords in:
  - Request/Response headers
  - Request payloads
  - Response bodies
- Customizable search scope with checkboxes
- Detailed view of all captured requests

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Search (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Ask natural language questions about network traffic
- Examples:
  - "What is my YouTube username?"
  - "Which request gives the QR code to login?"
  - "Find any authentication tokens"
  - "Show me API endpoints related to user data"
  - "Where is my account balance information?"
  - "Which request contains my profile picture URL?"
- Smart analysis of all captured network data
- Contextual answers with specific request details

## Roadmap

- Turn request into reclaim / primus / pluto / opacity templates
- Add sidebar showing every past search

## Code Organization

The codebase uses a centralized configuration approach for better maintainability:

### `config.js` - Centralized Configuration
Contains all hardcoded values that were previously scattered throughout the code:

- **API Configuration**: Gemini endpoints, model settings, and temperature values
- **Storage Keys**: LocalStorage key names for consistent data access  
- **Network Configuration**: Analysis timeouts, token limits, and debugger settings
- **AI Prompts**: All AI prompt templates for URL suggestions, keyword generation, and request analysis

This makes it easy to:
- Update API endpoints or model parameters in one place
- Modify analysis timeouts and limits
- Adjust AI prompt templates
- Maintain consistent configuration across all files

### File Structure
- `config.js` - Centralized configuration and prompts
- `background.js` - Service worker for tab management and network capture
- `options.js` - Main UI logic and AI processing
- `options.html` - User interface
- `manifest.json` - Extension permissions and metadata
